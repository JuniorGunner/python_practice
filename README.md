# python_practice

This repository is intended to serve as a centralized location for storing Python scripts that have been created while following various books and courses. It is a place to organize and keep track of code snippets and programs that have been learned and written over time. The repository may be useful for those who want to review the scripts later, or for those who want to share their work with others who may be interested in learning Python.
